# nodejs-api-auth-backend

## Used tools

Developed under:
- Node.js 16.13.0
- NPM 8.1.0
- MongoDB 5.0.2

One of the first step when developing a Node.js project, especially a REST API server, is to be able to accept
requests from clients and authenticate the users whether to only give access to whom granted or to record the use.
Apart from usual actions (sign up/in/out), it is possible to protect routes (see profile routes) with passport

## Features

- Data stored in MongoDB
- Sign up with a name and a password
- Sign in with a name and a password
- Sign out
- Protected routes (Profile) through JWT

## How to run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mphuget/nodejs-api-auth-backend.git

2. Go to the repository:

cd nodejs-api-auth-backend

3. Install the dependencies (removed from Git repository):

npm install

4. Create a directory for MongoDB data (select where to store them)

mkdir ./data

5. Run the MongoDB server from another directory than the data one (in a first terminal)

mongod --dbpath ./data

6. Rename the .env-example file into .env

7. Change the content of the .env file. The critical data are port on which the server is
running, and the MongoDB URL

8. On another terminal, run the server

node server.js

If everything went smoothly, you should see a running on port message and connected to database messages

The different routes were tested under Postman

## How to reuse 

From this code, it is possible to add an API

1. Create a file in the routes folder where you will provide all the routes for your API

2. Create a file in the controller folder where the corresponding behaviour will be added

3. (If needed) Add a file in the models folder for the model

4. Modify the server.js file to add the routes

Et voil√†! Enjoy!
